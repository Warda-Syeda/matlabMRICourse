**Part 2: MRI Images and Data Structures**


**Part 3: MATLAB for Structural MRI**

**Learning Objectives**

After finishing this lesson, the students should be able to

*   Demonstrate basic knowledge of structural DW-MRI image files.
*   Build bvecs and bvals files for DWI protocols.
*   Obtain DWI signal from each voxel in a given dataset.
*   Estimate noise levels in DWI signal and obtain clean signal.
*   Analyse and identify trends in DWI signals.
*   Fit simple DWI models to data using MATLAB’s curve-fitting toolbox.

**Part 4: MATLAB for Functional MRI**

**Learning Objectives**

After finishing this lesson, the students should be able to:
•	Demonstrate basic knowledge of 3D volumes and surfaces.
•	Extract the 3D surface of a 3D volume.
•	Visualise 3D surfaces and color coded surface attributes. 
•	Read and write 3D surfaces files in MATLAB.
