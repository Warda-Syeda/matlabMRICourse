# MATLAB for MRI Applications {#matlab-for-mri}


**Part 1: Introduction of MATLAB environment**

**Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson students should be able to

*   Develop sufficient knowledge of MATLAB command window and development environment.
*   Develop understanding of MATALB variables, vectors, arrays and structs and cell arrays.
*   Apply fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals to solve given problems.

**Part 2: MRI Images and Data Structures**

**Learning Objectives**

After completing this lesson, students should be able to

*   Identify Siemens DICOM and Bruker’s 2dseq MRI image files.
*   Analyse and identify the contents of MRI image files.
*   Create NIFTI image files for FSL and MRtrix tools.
*   Select and extract Regions of interest and image slices from multidimensional datasets.
*   Apply data visualisation techniques for presenting 4D MRI images.

**Part 3: MATLAB for Structural MRI**

**Learning Objectives**

After finishing this lesson, the students should be able to

*   Demonstrate basic knowledge of structural DW-MRI image files.
*   Build bvecs and bvals files for DWI protocols.
*   Obtain DWI signal from each voxel in a given dataset.
*   Estimate noise levels in DWI signal and obtain clean signal.
*   Analyse and identify trends in DWI signals.
*   Fit simple DWI models to data using MATLAB’s curve-fitting toolbox.

**Part 4: MATLAB for Functional MRI**

**Learning Objectives**

After finishing this lesson, the students should be able to:
•	Demonstrate basic knowledge of 3D volumes and surfaces.
•	Extract the 3D surface of a 3D volume.
•	Visualise 3D surfaces and color coded surface attributes. 
•	Read and write 3D surfaces files in MATLAB.
•	Convert 3D surface files to each other. (Time to advertisement :D :  Open ply file in 3D Slicer. Open both hemispheres.  Talk about 3D slicer and FSL and courses and FreeSurfer soon. Use 3D slicer to save .ply as .stl (we can do .vtk as well) and open it in MeshLab)


At the end of this lesson, the students should be able to
