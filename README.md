# MATLAB for MRI Applications {#matlab-for-mri}

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a unique imaging modality that allows us to image soft tissue noninvasively. Image contrast in generated by studying the magnetic properties of water molecules present in tissue under the influence of a very high magnetic field. MRI images can be T1- or T2-weighted depending upon the experimental parameters used during acquisition. 

In this course, we study, visualize and analyse a T2-weighted MRI dataset, acquired on a Philips scanner, in MATLAB. The image processing toolbox provides powerful functions for carrying out complex image operations efficiently. Unlike imaging software packages, when an MRI image is loaded into MATLAB, we get complete control over the data and information contained in it. This allows us to investigate and manipulate numerous image properties to further our research.
