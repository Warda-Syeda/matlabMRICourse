# MATLAB for MRI Applications {#matlab-for-mri}


**Part 1: Introduction of MATLAB environment**

**Learning Objectives**

By the end of this lesson students should be able to

*   Develop sufficient knowledge of MATLAB command window and development environment.
*   Develop understanding of MATALB variables, vectors, arrays and structs and cell arrays.
*   Apply fundamental programming concepts such as loops and conditionals to solve given problems.

**Part 2: MRI Images and Data Structures**

**Learning Objectives**

After completing this lesson, students should be able to

*   Identify Siemens DICOM and Bruker’s 2dseq MRI image files.
*   Analyse and identify the contents of MRI image files.
*   Create NIFTI image files for FSL and MRtrix tools.
*   Select and extract Regions of interest and image slices from multidimensional datasets.
*   Apply data visualisation techniques for presenting 4D or 5D MRI images.

**Part 3: MATLAB for Structural MRI**

**Learning Objectives**

After finishing this lesson, the students should be able to

*   Demonstrate basic knowledge of structural DW-MRI image files.
*   Build bvecs and bvals files for DWI protocols.
*   Obtain DWI signal from each voxel in a given dataset.
*   Estimate noise levels in DWI signal and obtain clean signal.
*   Analyse and identify trends in DWI signals.
*   Fit simple DWI models to data using MATLAB’s curve-fitting toolbox.

**Part 4: MATLAB for Functional MRI**

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this lesson, the students should be able to

**Notes**

**Part 1**


**Part 2**

Show and discuss example DICOM and 2dseq images, import/ read them in MATLAB

Convert them into Nifti files

Challenge 4

1.  Convert myImage.Img to a Nifti file
2.  Export Nifti file from MATLAB
3.  Read it in again and display in MATLAB

Show manual ROI selection techniques in different directions etc.

Challenge 5

List of online MATALB toolboxes
